PayForMe - Project Update

Dear {{ user_name }},

We wanted to let you know that your project "{{ project_title }}" has been removed from our featured section. This is a normal part of our rotation process to ensure all qualifying projects get the opportunity to be featured.

While your project is no longer featured, it's still active and available for backing on our platform.

View your project at: {{ project_url }}

Thank you for being part of our community!

Best regards,
The PayForMe Team
